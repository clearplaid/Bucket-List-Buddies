Landing Page (Home)
    show Nav
    show activity pics (clickable)
        api call () for activity / locations, 
        move to suggestion page -> showing top 10 (up to) locations,
    ?? any other opportunities on this page ??
    -we may want some movement on this page 
    -a video or a moving slideshow... 
    -the slideshow in a couple of the image areas could have closely related activities that can be linked to the api
    -giving us the ability to have more choices in a smaller area

Suggestion page (show top 10 suggested destinations)
    for each location, add button for other local attractions
    local attraction click:
        api call to get top 5 local attractions other than current activity
        generate list to screen
    ?? hyperlink selection of location ??
     -I like this idea...not sure where it should take us, though...I don't know if we want it to take them off our page
    ?? any other opportunities on this page ??
     -weather added maybe year round averages since we don't have dates yet
     -this might help with decision making for the user
     
Planning Page (?? must be logged in ??) - preload with acct info / location
-This could be started without an account but to save/submit need to log in or create account
-to view existing planning page need to log in
    new: 
        capture date range
        capture others to invite (name/email - possibly send email requesting join in group?)
        allow invite to other existing acct (search by name or email -- consider security ramifications)
        -invite only through email?? this means the person would have to already know the other peoples emails
        -or do we have a feature to search account holders already in the database?
        -I don't know a lot about the security stuff :(
    existing:
        show entire group's info (highlighting who picked what)
        show in relation to each other (?? large calendar view ??)
        -could we collect the date ranges of each group member and set them to a calendar with a different color for each 
        -this way the visual of who can go when has more impact??
    ?? how to select (i.e. other person changed my mind, let me replace my selection with theirs) - or suggest compromise
     -notes area to store communication between group members??
     -delete button for previously saved data
    ?? any other opportunities on this page ??
     -sidebar with the top chosen destinations/dates/and/or activities within the group
     -main has the individual group members saved choices in saved order
     -link back to the data
     
*personal suggestion:  mod project to just be a group event tracker instead of vacation planner, just to coordinate the event planning
    --Agreed:)
